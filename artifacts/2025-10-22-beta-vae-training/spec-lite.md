# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a β-VAE training pipeline that learns to encode 16×16 ARC grids into a d=10 latent space, achieving ≥90% pixel-wise reconstruction accuracy. The pipeline includes β-annealing (0→1→2), Weights & Biases integration, and sample generation from the learned prior for validation of generative capability.
