## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Implement β-VAE model architecture and core components
  - [ ] 1.1 Write tests for Encoder class (input/output shapes, latent distribution)
  - [ ] 1.2 Implement Encoder (CNN → μ, σ heads) in models/encoder.py
  - [ ] 1.3 Write tests for Decoder class (latent → logits shapes)
  - [ ] 1.4 Implement Decoder (dense → transposed CNN) in models/decoder.py
  - [ ] 1.5 Write tests for VAE class (forward pass, loss computation, reparameterization)
  - [ ] 1.6 Implement complete VAE model in models/beta_vae.py (integrate encoder/decoder, reparameterization trick)
  - [ ] 1.7 Verify all model tests pass

- [ ] 2. Set up data loading and preprocessing pipeline
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for dataset class (load .npz, return correct shapes, augmentation)
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement ARCDataset class in utils/data_loader.py (load from ../datasets/*.npz)
  - [ ] 2.3 Implement data augmentation (random rotation 90°/180°/270°, horizontal/vertical flip)
  - [ ] 2.4 Implement train/val/test DataLoaders with batch_size=128
  - [ ] 2.5 Verify data loading tests pass and inspect batch samples

- [ ] 3. Implement training loop with β-annealing and logging
  - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for β-annealing schedule (verify values at epochs 1, 10, 30, 50)
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement β-annealing function in training/train.py
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement loss computation (cross-entropy + β*KL) with proper dimensions
  - [ ] 3.4 Set up Weights & Biases integration (project config, metric logging)
  - [ ] 3.5 Implement training loop (optimizer, scheduler, gradient clipping, early stopping)
  - [ ] 3.6 Add checkpoint saving (every 10 epochs + best validation)
  - [ ] 3.7 Verify training loop runs for 2 epochs on small dataset (smoke test)

- [ ] 4. Implement evaluation metrics and visualization utilities
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for pixel-wise accuracy computation (edge cases: perfect/zero accuracy)
  - [ ] 4.2 Implement pixel_accuracy metric in utils/metrics.py
  - [ ] 4.3 Implement KL divergence monitoring (per dimension, detect collapse)
  - [ ] 4.4 Implement visualization functions (reconstructions grid, samples grid) in utils/visualization.py
  - [ ] 4.5 Create evaluation script training/evaluate.py (load checkpoint, compute test accuracy)
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify evaluation on dummy data produces expected metrics

- [ ] 5. Implement sample generation and create training configuration
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for sample generation (z ~ N(0,I) → valid grid shapes)
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement generate_samples function in training/generate_samples.py
  - [ ] 5.3 Create config/config.yaml with all hyperparameters from technical spec
  - [ ] 5.4 Add argparse support to training script (config path, resume from checkpoint)
  - [ ] 5.5 Create README.md with usage instructions (train, evaluate, generate samples)
  - [ ] 5.6 Verify sample generation script produces outputs

- [ ] 6. Full training run and validation
  - [ ] 6.1 Run full training (50 epochs on 100K corpus, ~2-3 hours on RTX 2080 Ti)
  - [ ] 6.2 Monitor W&B dashboard for training curves and sample quality
  - [ ] 6.3 Evaluate final model on test set (verify ≥90% pixel-wise accuracy)
  - [ ] 6.4 Generate random samples from prior and inspect quality
  - [ ] 6.5 Create latent space visualizations (PCA, t-SNE on test embeddings)
  - [ ] 6.6 Save final metrics to results/metrics.json
  - [ ] 6.7 Document results and any fallback actions taken (if accuracy <90%)
  - [ ] 6.8 Verify all deliverables complete (checkpoints, W&B logs, evaluation report, sample script)
