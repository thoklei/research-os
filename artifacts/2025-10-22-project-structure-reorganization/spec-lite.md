# Spec Summary (Lite)

Reorganize the project repository by moving legacy experimental files and debug scripts to a legacy/ directory, establishing proper test directory structure mirroring src/ layout, relocating experiment run storage to project/experiments/runs/ outside src/, and creating project/issues/ for issue documentation. All changes must preserve functionality with passing test suite verification.
