# Large-Scale Dataset Generation - Lite Summary

Scale the atomic image generator from demo-scale (10 images) to production-scale datasets (1K → 100K images) with minimal pipeline changes, using hierarchical .npz storage with uint8 compression and phased validation including CLI interface, memory estimation, and visual validation tools.

## Key Points
- Scale from 10 images to 100K with minimal changes to existing pipeline.py
- Hierarchical .npz storage with uint8 datatype for memory efficiency
- Phased validation (1K → 10K → 100K) with CLI tools and progress tracking
