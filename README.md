# Research-OS

**An agentic research engineering ecosystem for Claude Code**

Research-OS is an orchestration system built on top of Claude Code that combines rigorous research planning with professional engineering implementation. It provides a structured workflow for transforming research ideas into fully implemented, production-ready code through spec- and test-driven development principles with sophisticated context engineering.

## Overview

Research-OS separates the cognitive work of research planning from the execution work of engineering implementation through two specialized, marketplace-compatible plugins that can be used independently or together:

- **Researcher Plugin**: Focuses on hypothesis development, literature review, and experiment planning
- **Engineer Plugin**: Handles spec-driven development with implementation and verification workflows

This separation enables:
- Clear distinction between "what to build" (research) and "how to build it" (engineering)
- Reusable research artifacts that inform multiple implementations
- Professional development practices with automated verification
- Sophisticated context engineering through standards and templates

## Key Features

### üî¨ Research-First Development
- Systematic hypothesis refinement and validation
- Comprehensive literature review and related work analysis
- Experiment roadmap with dependency tracking
- Mission-driven project planning

### üèóÔ∏è Spec-Driven Implementation
- Requirements gathering with visual asset support
- Detailed specification generation
- Strategic task breakdown with agent assignments
- Automated verification and testing

### ü§ñ Multi-Agent Orchestration
- 17 specialized agents across research and engineering domains
- Intelligent task delegation based on agent expertise
- Parallel execution for independent tasks
- Context passing between agents via file artifacts

### üìê Standards & Quality
- Customizable coding standards and conventions
- Automatic code quality checks (via ruff)
- Test-driven development support
- Comprehensive documentation at every phase

## Installation

Research-OS is compatible with the Claude Code marketplace and plugin system. If you want to use this as-is, add this marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add wielandbrendel/research-os
```

If you want to make local changes, instead add your local copy:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add ./research-os
```

Then browse and install individual plugins (commands or agents):

```bash
/plugin
```

For more details on the Claude Code plugin system, see the [official documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins)

## Usage

### Phase 1: Research Planning

Start with the Researcher plugin to develop your research vision:

```bash
/plan-research
```

This comprehensive command will:
1. Guide you through iterative hypothesis refinement
2. Research related work and existing solutions
3. Create a compelling mission statement
4. Generate an experiment roadmap with phases
5. Document technical requirements

Output is created in `research-os/project/`:
- `research-journal.md` - Iterative refinement history
- `related-work.md` - Literature review and analysis
- `mission.md` - Project vision and goals
- `roadmap.md` - Phased experiment plan
- `tech-stack.md` - Technical requirements

### Phase 2: Engineering Implementation

Use the Engineer plugin to implement your research vision:

#### 1. Initialize a new artifact
```bash
/new-artifact [feature-description]
```
- Gathers requirements through targeted questions
- Processes visual references if provided
- Creates initial planning documentation

#### 2. Create detailed specifications
```bash
/create-artifact
```
- Analyzes requirements and context
- Generates comprehensive `spec.md`
- Creates strategic `tasks.md` with agent assignments

#### 3. Implement the artifact
```bash
/implement-artifact
```
- Delegates to specialized implementation agents
- Executes tasks in parallel where possible
- Runs verification workflows
- Produces implementation reports

Output is organized in `research-os/artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD-artifact-name/`:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ planning/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ initialization.md    # Raw idea capture
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.md      # Gathered requirements
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ visuals/            # Reference images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.md                  # Detailed specification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md                 # Task breakdown with assignments
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation/          # Implementation reports per task
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ verification/           # Verification reports
```

## Agent Ecosystem

## Standards & Customization

Research-OS uses a sophisticated standards system that can be customized per user or project.

### Default Standards Location
The Engineer plugin includes default standards in `plugins/engineer/standards/`:
- `global/` - Coding style, conventions, error handling
- `testing/` - Unit tests, coverage requirements

### User Customization
Create your own standards in `~/.research-os/standards/`:

```bash
~/.research-os/standards/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ global/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coding-style.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conventions.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ error-handling.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tech-stack.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testing/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coverage.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unit-tests.md
```

### How Standards Work
1. **Automatic Copying**: When initializing a new project, standards from `~/.research-os/standards/` are automatically copied as a starting point
3. **Project-Specific**: Each project can modify its local standards without affecting global defaults
4. **Inheritance**: Projects start with user standards, falling back to plugin defaults if not customized

## Workflow Examples

### Example: Building a Research Tool
```bash
# Phase 1: Research
/plan-research
# Develops hypothesis for novel visualization approach
# Researches existing tools and methods
# Creates roadmap for validation experiments

# Phase 2: Implementation
/new-artifact interactive-visualization-dashboard
# Gathers specific requirements
# Processes mockups and wireframes

/create-artifact
# Generates detailed specs
# Creates task breakdown

/implement-artifact
# Implements with specialized agents
# Verifies functionality
```

## Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- **Research Phase**: Focus on "what" and "why"
- **Engineering Phase**: Focus on "how" and implementation details
- **Clear handoff points** between phases via documented artifacts

### Context Engineering

## Philosophy

Research-OS embodies several key principles:

1. **Research Before Implementation**: Think deeply before coding
2. **Specification as Contract**: Clear specs prevent scope creep
3. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent excels in its domain
4. **Documentation as First-Class**: Every decision is documented
5. **Standards Enable Scale**: Consistency across projects
6. **Verification Builds Trust**: Automated checks ensure quality
