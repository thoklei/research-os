# Legacy Files

This directory contains historical code, experiments, and configurations that are no longer actively used but are preserved for reference.

## Directory Structure

- **scripts/** - Debug scripts and one-off utilities
  - Debug scripts: `debug_*.py`, `diagnose_*.py`
  - One-off utilities: `simple_gen.py`, `compute_class_weights.py`, `show_images.py`, etc.

- **experiments/** - Old experiment outputs
  - `0.2-beta-vae/` - Initial Î²-VAE training experiment (before run manager implementation)

- **configs/** - Legacy configuration files
  - Standalone config.json files from early experiments

## Purpose

These files are retained for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding previous approaches and experiments
- Debugging if old experiment results need to be reproduced

## Note

This code is **not actively maintained** and may not work with the current codebase without modifications.
