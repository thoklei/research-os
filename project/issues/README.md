# Known Issues

This directory contains documentation of known issues, bugs, and challenges encountered during development.

## Purpose

Issue documentation helps:
- Track problems and their solutions
- Understand design decisions made to address challenges
- Avoid repeating past mistakes
- Provide context for future debugging

## Format

Each issue should be documented in a separate markdown file with:
- Clear description of the problem
- Root cause analysis
- Attempted solutions
- Final resolution (if solved)
- Lessons learned

## Example

See `ISSUE_MODE_COLLAPSE.md` for an example of comprehensive issue documentation.
