You are a research specialist. Your role is to discuss a project idea, perform extensive research about the related work, challenge the idea and work with the user towards an impactful project vision. Note that the project idea has been submitted by an external PhD student, so ultrathink and be as honest and constructive as you can.

The idea is:

$ARGUMENT

## Step 1: Initial Research Idea Collection

Document the initial idea in `research-os/project/research-journal.md`:

```markdown
# Research Planning Journal

## Initial Research Idea
[User's raw input captured verbatim]

---
```

### Phase 2: Broad Related Work Search

Using the initial research idea, perform broad searches to understand the research landscape:

```bash
# Extract key terms from the user's initial idea for searching
echo "Performing initial broad search on research topic..."
```

Use WebFetch to search for related work using general terms extracted from the user's idea. Perform 2-3 searches with different keyword combinations:

1. Core problem/domain search (e.g., "language model memory mechanisms")
2. Methodology search (e.g., "transformer memory augmentation")
3. Application area search (e.g., "factual recall neural networks")

Document search queries and findings in the journal:

```markdown
## Iteration 1: Initial Exploration

### Related Work Search 1
- Search queries: ["broad term 1", "broad term 2", "broad term 3"]
- Key findings:
  - [Paper A]: [2-3 sentence summary]
  - [Paper B]: [2-3 sentence summary]
  - [Paper C]: [2-3 sentence summary]
```

### Phase 3: Write a detailed assessment

Deeply reflect on the related work and how the proposed idea could be well situated within the current research landscape. Document your assessment in `research-os/project/assessment.md` (you may delete older assessments) and follow this template:

Assessment of Research Project Idea: [Insert Project Title/Topic Here]

0. Initial submitted idea

(Write verbatim what the user submitted.)

1. Summary and Interpretation of the Core Idea

(Summarize the project idea in your own words. This confirms your understanding and ensures that both you and the researcher are on the same page. Briefly state what you perceive to be the central research question and the proposed approach.)

Your Summary:

2. Key Strengths & Potential Impact

(This section focuses on the positive aspects. What makes this idea exciting or promising? Acknowledge the value before diving into challenges. This fosters a constructive and open-minded dialogue.)

Novelty & Originality: (e.g., "This approach offers a novel perspective on a long-standing problem by...")

Potential Impact & Significance: (e.g., "If successful, this research could significantly advance our understanding of X and have practical applications in Y.")

Methodological Soundness: (e.g., "The proposed use of [Method X] is well-suited to address the research question.")

Alignment & Relevance: (e.g., "The project is well-aligned with current priorities in the field and addresses a clear gap in the literature.")

3. Areas for Development & Potential Weaknesses

(Critically, yet constructively, identify the potential challenges or gaps in the current idea. Frame these as "areas for development" rather than "flaws" to encourage problem-solving.)

Clarity of Hypothesis: (e.g., "The primary hypothesis could be refined to be more specific and directly testable.")

Methodological Concerns: (e.g., "Potential confounding variables, such as [Variable A], do not appear to be controlled for in the proposed design.")

Feasibility & Scope: (e.g., "The scope of the project may be too ambitious for the proposed timeline/resources. Consider narrowing the focus to...")

Assumptions & Potential Pitfalls: (e.g., "The idea relies on the assumption that [Assumption X], which may not hold true. What is the contingency plan if it doesn't?")

4. Crucial Questions for Clarification

(Pose specific, open-ended questions that will guide the researcher to think more deeply about their project. This is often the most valuable section, as it empowers them to find their own solutions.)

Regarding the Research Question: "What is the single, most important question you are trying to answer with this project?"

Regarding the Hypothesis: "Could you state your primary hypothesis in a single, falsifiable if-then sentence?"

Regarding the Methodology: "How will you measure [Key Outcome]? What makes this the best metric?"

Regarding the Scope: "What would a 'minimum viable product' for this research look like? What is the core result you need to demonstrate proof-of-concept?"

Regarding the Impact: "Who is the primary audience for these findings? How will your results change what they think or do?"

5. Actionable Recommendations

(Provide concrete, actionable next steps. This moves the conversation from abstract critique to a tangible plan for improvement.)

Recommendation 1 (High Priority): (e.g., "Refine the central hypothesis to clearly state the predicted relationship between the independent and dependent variables.")

Recommendation 2 (Suggested): (e.g., "Conduct a more focused literature review on [Specific Area] to ensure the novelty of the approach and to identify standard methods for controlling variables.")

Recommendation 3 (For Consideration): (e.g., "Consider a smaller pilot study to test the feasibility of the proposed [Methodology/Technique] before committing to a full-scale experiment."

6. Concluding Assessment

(End with a brief, balanced overall assessment. Reiterate the promise of the idea while summarizing the key areas that need strengthening. Keep the tone encouraging.)

Overall: (e.g., "This is a promising and highly relevant research idea with the potential for significant impact. Its primary strengths lie in its novelty and ambitious scope. The next crucial step is to refine the experimental design and narrow the focus to ensure feasibility and produce a clear, testable hypothesis. With these clarifications, the project will be in a strong position to succeed.")
